# EVERYTHING HERE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
## Small bio (W.I.P)
I'm an extremely addicted gamer who has over 12k hours in terraria as my username implies, on my other accounts (johnnyjj45) I work on a massive project oy mine nammed "The Story Of Legends: Reborn" (TSOL:R) or sometimes referred to as Project "Fractured space", I'll put something below later that will explain what it is.
Not only do I live video games (or anything electronic related for that matter) but I'd also tend to roleplay (digitally), voice act, write scripts, try to make videos for YouTube, and I'm a MASSIVE lore fan.
I may only use this github account for game related things, while using my main account (johnnyjj45) for other things like TSOL:R.

# TSOL:R Explanation (W.I.P)
TSOL:R aka Project "Fractured Space" is

I use several other verses for inspiration, one of which being the video game called Undertale being one of the bigger inspirations, I'm not going to explain how for reasons but letting you figure that out yourself sounds fun... I might as well add hints here every few weeks (or months) or so to help.

# More about me (W.I.P)
## List of things that I do (W.I.P)
### TSOL:R (W.I.P)
There's a LOT of things that I do for this project, such as:
1. The server-side script (only visible to me and a few chosen individuals, used for NPC managment as most of what's inside the players can and probablly will refuse to follow, it only contains actions for my creations anyway)
2. Long creation (Characters, Items, Race/Species, etc.) info documents possibly containing over 10 pages each (These are the advanced versions which are revamps of the orginal creation info cards found on Trello, having even more detail and info than before)
### Games I play (W.I.P)
This may take a long time to list nearly **everygame** game that I've **ever** played, but here we go (Yes, I'm even listing ones that may give me hate for no appearent reasons EVEN IF IT WAS YEARS SINCE I PLAYED THEM-- what I'm trying to say is that I'm listing **EVERY** game I've played, doesn't matter what):
1. Terraria: used to play the game I think when I was 8 on our old xbox 360 we once had, eventually moving over to playstation 4 having over 10k hours in a single character (meaning I was playing the game for that long WHILE I was using the character), and moving over to PC after a few years to play both vanilla (I'm only missing the last fishing fishing quest achievement with about 128 fish left) and modded (beaten calamity mod on expert revengeance both two times both runs taking less than 2 days to complete, and I'm now actively trying to do expert death mode)
2. Minecraft: my strange "hyper addiction" towards terraria practically moved over to this game but I forgot when, I believe I also have at least 5k hours in this game too but it might be more
3. Doom: I've played and beaten both Doom and Doom eternal (I'll put what difficulty here once I get access to both games again) and I believe ancient gods too, but it's hard to remember. I'll be playing Doom The Dark Ages next hopefully in a few days, and I'll record my reaction as well that I might upload to my YouTube channel.
4.
